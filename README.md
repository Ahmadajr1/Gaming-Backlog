### Gaming-Backlog
## Description:
The objective of this app is to track games' progress. Users can add their games and write 
short summaries of the last things they did in their gaming sessions,
in addition of adding what they want to do in their next gaming sessions.

This is a simple solution to a common issue of not gamers not remembering what happened in their last gaming session or what to do next.

## Features to be impleneted:
1- Look for an API that will provide games covers and titles to the user automatically.

2- Add customizable UI (Possibly from existing public libraries)
